-- A worked example, and the seed mechanism's own documentation.
--
-- Seeds are FIRST-BOOT ONLY. The row is inserted if no business with this id
-- exists yet, and is never written again -- so anything an admin changes or
-- deletes in-game stays changed or deleted across restarts. Delete this file if
-- you would rather build everything from scratch with `/business`.
--
-- Nothing here needs to be hand-written on your own server: `/business` builds
-- the same structure in-world, with the zone creator and the prop placer doing
-- the coordinates for you. This file exists so you can see the shape.
